# Contributing to AnduinOS Packages

This document captures the architectural conventions and best practices
developed for AnduinOS APKG packages. Follow these when adding or modifying
packages.

## The Holy Trinity: Provides, Conflicts, Replaces

Every fork package that replaces an upstream Ubuntu package **must** declare
all three relationships, in this exact order:

```xml
<Provides>upstream-package</Provides>
<Conflicts>upstream-package</Conflicts>
<Replaces>upstream-package</Replaces>
```

**Why all three:**

| Relationship | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Provides` | Satisfies other packages' Depends/Recommends on the upstream name, preventing APT deadlocks |
| `Conflicts` | Blocks the upstream package from being co-installed alongside our fork |
| `Replaces` | Allows our package to overwrite files owned by the upstream package during upgrade |

**One without the others is a bug:**

- `Conflicts` alone → APT deadlocks when something `Recommends` the upstream package
- `Provides` + `Replaces` without `Conflicts` → both packages can coexist, causing file conflicts
- `Provides` + `Conflicts` without `Replaces` → upgrade path may fail on file overwrites

## Fork vs. Swap: When to Use Which

### Fork (new package name, P-C-R)

Use when the upstream package contains **security-sensitive or frequently
updated logic** that we must track. Our fork derives from upstream's .deb,
patches what we need, and declares P-C-R.

```xml
<PackageName>anduinos-software-properties-common</PackageName>
<Provides>software-properties-common</Provides>
<Conflicts>software-properties-common</Conflicts>
<Replaces>software-properties-common</Replaces>
```

Examples: `anduinos-software-properties-common`, `anduinos-software-properties-gtk`.

### Swap (same package name, epoch 1:)

Use when our package is a **complete replacement** with no need to track
upstream updates — branding, wallpapers, base system identity.

```xml
<PackageName>base-files</PackageName>
<PackageVersion>1:13.5+anduinos1</PackageVersion>
```

The epoch `1:` outranks any Ubuntu version. Use sparingly.

Examples: `base-files`.

## Metapackage Design

### Own your critical infrastructure

If your metapackage `Conflicts` with a session package (e.g., `ubuntu-session`),
it **must** explicitly depend on the packages that would otherwise become
orphaned and get swept away by `apt autoremove`:

```xml
<Conflicts>ubuntu-session</Conflicts>

<!-- These would be orphans without ubuntu-session — we claim them -->
<Dependency Include="gnome-session" />
<Dependency Include="gdm3" />
<Dependency Include="xwayland" />
```

APT treats the metapackage as the new owner. `autoremove` will never touch them.

### Be restrained: don't over-claim

- **Do** conflict with packages that break your brand identity (session, shell theme)
- **Do not** conflict with `ubuntu-desktop` or `ubuntu-desktop-minimal` — users may need them as dependency anchors
- **Do not** conflict with wallpaper packages — let users choose their own desktop background
- **Do not** `Provides` the Ubuntu metapackage identity unless you genuinely satisfy all its contracts

### Conditionally include suite-specific packages

Use MSBuild `Condition` attributes when a dependency only exists for certain
Ubuntu releases:

```xml
<Dependency Include="anduinos-software-properties-gtk" Condition="'$(Suite)' == 'resolute-addon'" />
```

## Upstream Derivation Patterns

### Suppress upstream maintainer scripts

Always suppress for fork packages. Our patches would break if upstream's
postinst/postrm ran:

```xml
<SuppressUpstreamScripts>true</SuppressUpstreamScripts>
```

### Suppress unwanted inherited dependencies

Upstream packages sometimes depend on things we don't want (adware, Pro
client, etc.). Strip them:

```xml
<SuppressUpstreamDependencies>ubuntu-pro-client ubuntu-advantage-desktop-daemon</SuppressUpstreamDependencies>
```

Space or comma separated. Base package name matching (version constraints
stripped before comparison).

### Symlink, don't bundle, distro data files

When you need distro identity files (like `anduinos.info` → `ubuntu.info`),
use relative symlinks with explicit runtime dependencies:

```xml
<PrebuildCommand Run="for d in obj/*; do mkdir -p &quot;$d/usr/share/python-apt/templates&quot; &amp;&amp; ln -sf ubuntu.info &quot;$d/usr/share/python-apt/templates/anduinos.info&quot;; done" />

<!-- Guarantee the symlink target exists at runtime -->
<Dependency Include="python-apt-common" />
```

Never copy static data files from the host system into the package — they will
go stale and break reproducibility.

### PrebuildCommand ordering matters

`PrebuildCommand` runs **before** `MergeDepends`. This means your sed patches
execute on the raw upstream control file, and then the local dependencies are
merged in. The upstream dependencies flow through automatically — you don't
need to re-declare them.

## Dconf Defaults: Co-locate with the Component

Bundle each component's dconf defaults inside its own package, not in a
monolithic config package:

```xml
<IncludeFile Include="dconf/14-dash-to-panel.conf"
             Target="/etc/dconf/db/anduinos.d/14-dash-to-panel.conf" />
```

This way, when the user removes the component package, its dconf defaults
are cleaned up automatically by dpkg.

## GNOME Shell Extensions

- **Same UUID, same package name root**: If our extension has the same UUID
  as Ubuntu's, use P-C-R (dpkg will refuse to install both due to file conflict).
- **Different UUID, same function**: Use P-C-R at the meta-package level
  (`anduinos-gnome-extensions` provides `gnome-shell-ubuntu-extensions`).
- Always bundle the extension's schema compilation as a post-install script:
  ```bash
  glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
  ```

## Package Versioning

- Fork packages: `$(UpstreamVersion)+anduinos1` — tracks upstream version
  with our revision suffix.
- Native packages: semantic versioning (`1.0.2`).
- Suite-differentiated versions: `64+$(SuiteShortName)2` for extensions that
  ship different code per GNOME release.

## Before Submitting

- [ ] All three P-C-R relationships declared (for fork packages)
- [ ] `SuppressUpstreamScripts` is `true` (for derived packages)
- [ ] No static copies of host system files — use symlinks with explicit Depends
- [ ] Metapackages own their critical infrastructure deps explicitly
- [ ] `Condition` attributes are used where a dep only applies to specific suites
- [ ] Dconf defaults are co-located with their component
- [ ] `apkg lint` passes
